# bladeiron_api
High-level client-side API (JSONRPC 2.0) for dApp development using **11BE: BladeIron**.
# 

BladeIron is the second iteration of the original **11BE: CastIron** with unified JSONRPC backend. Comparing to previous approach in CastIron, it offers unified and abstracted API towards both geth and go-ipfs APIs, and could easily be expanded with additional peer-to-peer services without having developers and their dApps to connect to multiple node / daemon processes.

Please checkout the wiki to learn more about the API.
